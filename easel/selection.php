    <h1 class="Important">- Choosing Subjects -</h1>
    <div class="Content">
        <p>
            Choosing subjects to study should be based on three things:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>ABILITY - how good you are at subjects.</li>
            <li>INTEREST - which subjects you enjoy most.</li>
            <li>CAREER, OCCUPATION AND FUTURE STUDY INTENTIONS - If you know what career or tertiary course your want to follow, find out what subjects you need to enter these career areas or courses. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Remember the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Keep the course you choose a broad one - across a range of subjects and curriculum areas.</li>
            <li>Make sure you continue studying English, Mathematics and Science for as long as you can.</li>
            <li>Do NOT make a choice based on what your friends are doing or who the teacher is.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>
